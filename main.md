calculated by dividing the current stock price by the company's earnings per
share (EPS). It's a measure of how the market values the company's earnings. A
high PE ratio may indicate that the market has high expectations for future
earnings growth, while a low PE ratio might suggest undervaluation.

PE Ratio = Stock Price / Earnings per Share

Interpretation:

- PE Ratio < Industry Average: The stock
  might be undervalued.
- PE Ratio > Industry Average: The stock
  might be overvalued.

The
debt-to-equity ratio is calculated by dividing the company's total debt by its
shareholders' equity. It's a measure of a company's financial leverage and
risk.
